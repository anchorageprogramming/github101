Github 101
=========

A training project for github.

# What is github?
It is a web-based hosting service for software development projects using the Git revision control system. 
*Stolen from [wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GitHub).*

# What does that mean?
Are you familiar with Wikipedia? People from all over the world are able to edit, view, and add to the information on Wikipedia. Github is a similar concept.
* **Central Access**: As long as someone has internet access, she can access the project.
* **Track Changes**: Using git, you can see the history of changes made to a file.
* **Collaboration**: Others can use your project as a starting point for their own effrts, or contribute to yours. Using git, merging your changes with other people's changes is simplified.

# What is git?
If Github is like x, git is like y. Git is how we track and collaborate, github is where we store a project.

# Why use github?
It's free for projects that are public for all to see. It's a good place for people to give you feedback, potential employers to check out your work, and to store our work as we learn to code.

# Create an Account
https://github.com/

# Create a Repo
* Click the **New Repository** button on the main github page. 
* Pick a project name, select a *public* repo, and check the box to initialize it with a readme.

# Check out your Repo
* Hmmmm.........how do we work locally on a project that exists on the website? We need a client. 
* Download the app and install using the appropriate link below:
  * Windows: http://windows.github.com/
  * Mac: http://mac.github.com/
* Follow the instructions to install the github client.

# Check out your Repo Part II
* Once the github client is installed and open, click on your username on the right.
* Select the project and click clone
* Click the arrow next to your project, you will see your initial commit.

# Make a Change
* While on your project in the github client, click the **tools** menu item at the top of the page.
* Select **open in explorer**
* Open up the **README.md** file in a text editor like notepad.
* Edit a line of text in the file.
* Add a line of text to the file, anything you want, and save it. 

# Commit your Change
* Open your github client back up, and you'll see a message in the upper right that says "uncommitted changes".
* Click **Show** and you will see your changes on the left. Red means a line was removed. Green means a line was added.
* Review your changes. Are you satisfied with what you see? If not, go back and make more changes to the file.
* Once you are ready, you can fill out the box on the right with a commit messages.
* The commit message should succintly describe the changes you made. If you need to be in depth, use the extended description box.
* Click **commit**

# Check the Github site for your changes
* Switch back to the browser where your github project lives, do you see your changes?
* Changes made on your local machine are not pushed back up to the global repo until you sync your code.
* Switch back to the github client, click the highlighted **sync** button at the top of the window.
* Now if you head back to the website, you can review your changes.
