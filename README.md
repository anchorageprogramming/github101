## What is GitHub?
It is a web-based hosting service for software development projects using the Git revision control system. 
*Stolen from [wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GitHub).*

## What does that mean?
Are you familiar with Wikipedia? People from all over the world are able to edit, view, and add to the information on Wikipedia. Github is a similar concept.
* **Central Access**: As long as someone has internet access, she can access the project.
* **Track Changes**: Using git, you can see the history of changes made to a file.
* **Collaboration**: Others can use your project as a starting point for their own efforts, or contribute to yours. With git, merging your changes with other people's changes is simplified.

## What is Git?
Git is a version control system, a way to manage changes to documents. Git is how we track and manage files, github is where we store a project and collaborate.
* **Local Repository**: Collection of documents on your local machine.
* **Remote Repository**: Collection of documents on another machine.
* **Commit**: Snapshot of changes to a document.
* **Sync**: Push and pull changes with a remote repository.

## Create an account

## Create a repo (repository)
* Click the **New Repository** button on the main github page. 
* Select the suggested name for your project.
* Add the description *My First GitHub Repo*.

	* Don't worry about the drop-downs below it (.gitignore and license).

## Check out your repo
* <del>Once the github client is installed,</del> Add your GitHub username information to the client on your machine. 
* Click on your username on the left.

* Click the arrow next to your project; you will see your initial commit.

## Make a change
* While on your project in the GitHub client, click the **Tools** menu item at the top of the page.
* Select **open in explorer**

## Check the GitHub site for your changes
* Switch back to the browser where your GitHub project/website lives, do you see your changes? *(No! And it's OK. Read on.)*
* Changes made on your local machine are not pushed back up to the global repo until you sync your code.
* Switch back to the GitHub client, and click the highlighted **sync** button at the top of the window.
* Now if you head back to the website, you can review your changes.

## Why use GitHub?
It's free for projects that are public for all to see. It's a good place for people to give you feedback, potential employers to check out your work, and to store our work as we learn to code.
