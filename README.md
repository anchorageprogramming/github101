## What is github?
It is a web-based hosting service for software development projects using the Git revision control system. 
*Stolen from [wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GitHub).*

## What does that mean?
Are you familiar with Wikipedia? People from all over the world are able to edit, view, and add to the information on Wikipedia. Github is a similar concept.
* **Central Access**: As long as someone has internet access, she can access the project.
* **Track Changes**: Using git, you can see the history of changes made to a file.
* **Collaboration**: Others can use your project as a starting point for their own efforts, or contribute to yours. With git, merging your changes with other people's changes is simplified.

## What is git?
Git is a version control system, a way to manage changes to documents. Git is how we track and manage files, github is where we store a project and collaborate.
* **Local Repository**: Collection of documents on your local machine.
* **Remote Repository**: Collection of documents on another machine.
* **Commit**: Snapshot of changes to a document.
* **Sync**: Push and pull changes with a remote repository.
